Some examples for iOS 12 shortcuts (you know, for the LOLs).

DOWNLOADING? Open this page with your iPhone/iPad, press "view code". Click on the file you would like to open and then download binary (these are binary encoded files). Now, send the downloaded file to "Shortcuts" app.

1. IMDB info - dictate a movie title and it will read you the IMDB synopsis. 
  -- Pretty nice example of how to fetch HTML, parse it using simple regex and convert the results into usable data
  
2. IMDB rating - dictate and movie title and it will read you the rating value.
  -- this is a good example of fetching HTML results, parsing and then fetching subpages to get the underlying info.
  
3. IMDB this - dictate a movie title and it will try to find your movie for you.
  -- this is a simple example of iterating the regex data that you found.
  
4. Translate conversation - a simple example of infinitely looping dication, translation, validation and recursion.
  -- note the silly issue of the dictation step giving you the last result when you cancel it (simple duplicate checker).
  
5. Live photo - GIF. Basically takes a live image that you can share it to, converts it into animated GIF or movie and saves it to a file, clipboard, email or shares it to social networks (Twitterbot not tested)
   
6. Navigate to photo. Take a photo (choose or use via share) and navigate to the location where that photo was taken via Waze, Google maps or Apple maps.

Enjoy!
